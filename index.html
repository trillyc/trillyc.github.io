  <h2>Day 1</h2>

  <h3>Service design for the NHS: the open door (Matt’s keynote)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Matt’s journey: the meeting of ‘top down’ (GDS) and ‘bottom up’ (Service Jam) approaches to service design in organisations</li>
    <li>‘Design is the rendering of intent’ (Jared Spool) - need to up my design craft to be a better renderer!</li>
    <li>'More of healthcare needs more service design more of the time’. It’s more complex and nuanced, less transactional, more human. Human-centred design has more to offer in both establishing and rendering intent.</li>
    <li>Service pacing and ‘time as a material’ - critical to getting the balance of clinical, practical and emotional needs right.</li>
    <li>Service design in healthcare has impacts beyond services’ ‘users’. The inclusion and participation of these groups is crucial to successful service design in the NHS.</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>

  <h3>Creating safe spaces for challenge - being a lead assessor for Government Service Standard assessments</h3>
  <p>A lot of creating a safe space for teams at assessment is recognising the numerous pressures for them in being assessed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>doing right by the standard vs. 'assessment prep'</li>  
    <li>travelling to London before an assessment (more regional assessments please)</li>
    <li>feeling their hard work is under scrutiny/on the line</li>
    <li>not always being given internal support to work in a standard-aligned way</li>
    <li>not always having influence they need to change what they’d like to</li>
    <li>fear of repercussions of perceived ‘failure’ internally</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Lead assessors have key a role to play in setting the tone for the panel and the team</p>
  <p>Idea: crowdsource experienced lead assessors for advice for new lead assessors, include (as standard) in assessor training<p>
  <p>A particularly <a href="">unvarnished tweet</a> of mine was referenced (twice!) - v. honoured!</p>
